I’ve always had this deep love for cameras and capturing moments that tell a story.  Instagram : [sk_clicks_01](https://www.instagram.com/sk_clicks_01/)

Right now, I’m using a Sony A7III mirrorless camera, and I’ve invested in a couple of GM lenses to get that crisp, cinematic look I’m always chasing. Lately, I’ve been really into creating cinematic videos—whether it’s travel clips, lifestyle shots, or just experimenting with light and movement to give my videos that movie-like feel. 

It’s kind of become my creative outlet, and whenever I finish something I’m proud of, I’ll usually post it on my Instagram. There’s just something super satisfying about turning simple moments into something that looks straight out of a film.
