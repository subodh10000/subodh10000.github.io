My Passion for Badminton

Badminton has been a huge part of my life for as long as I can remember. It’s more than just a sport for me—it’s something that keeps me grounded and constantly pushing my limits. Since joining NJIT, I’ve stayed undefeated, winning gold in every tournament on campus. On top of that, I’ve had the opportunity to represent NJIT in inter-university competitions—and I’m proud to say I brought home gold there too.

Beyond the wins, badminton has taught me discipline, focus, and how to stay calm under pressure. It’s also just something I genuinely love—there’s nothing better than being on the court, in the zone, with a racket in hand.
