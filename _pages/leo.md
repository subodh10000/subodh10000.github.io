I was one of the founding members of the club and got really involved in social projects from the start. After a while, I took on the role of IT Officer, helping manage all the tech stuff. 

I organized over 5 hands-on IT workshops for students in rural villages, introducing them to key topics like the internet, coding, and cybersecurity, helping bridge the digital divide.

Now, even though I’m in the US, I’m still serving as the club advisor remotely, staying connected and supporting the team as they keep pushing forward. I enjoyed my time there and learned a lot.
