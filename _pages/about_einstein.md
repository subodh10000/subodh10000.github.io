Namaste, My name is Subodh Kathayat. You can also call me SK. I’m a tech enthusiast and athlete, always looking to learn and push myself. My journey into tech started with a love for problem-solving, which led me to create [Neptou—a tourism](https://www.tiktok.com/@kantipurtvhd/video/7179143375092796673) startup that helps travelers discover Nepal’s hidden gems while supporting local communities. 

When I’m not working on tech projects, I’m probably out snapping photos with my Sony A7III. Check out my work [here!](https://www.instagram.com/sk_clicks_01/)

I also run a non-profit [AashaKaPaila](https://www.instagram.com/aashakapaila/) where we focus on projects that bring growth and positive change to communities.

Feel free to hit me up if you want to chat about tech, photography, or anything else! Let’s connect.
