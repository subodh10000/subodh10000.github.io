I am proud to be the Founder and President of **Aasha Ka Paila**, a non-profit organization founded in 2020 during the pandemic with the aim of helping people in need. 

We started with 5 members initially, and now we have over 30 amazing active members. Each year, we carry out projects where we donate clean, wearable clothes, household supplies, menstrual kits, stationery items, etc. Our targeted beneficiaries include homeless families, orphanages, senior homes, street animals, and many more. To date, we have served more than 300 families. Our mission is to help 2000+ families by 2030.

Our funding comes from friends, families, personal savings, and other club collaborations.
